/**
 * Paste new script for owned servers to run. Kills all scripts
 * on server before proceeding. Servers can be excluded.
 * Divides servers into groups with set roles.
 * Script works poorly if servers differ in RAM size,
 * as action speed vary so greatly.
 *
 * Group size dynamic roles:
 *      1: Weaken
 *      2: Grow
 *      3: Hack
 *
 * Example:
 *  See how groups will look. Dryrun, meaning no changes are made, only calculated:
 *      ./update-owned-server.js 1
 *
 *  Normal run:
 *      ./update-owned-server.js
 *
 * TODO:
 *      Divide into groups and use a singleton on home that tracks who is doing what, so if
 *      2 in the group is weakening and it will cause Security level to be at target level:
 *      Start hack in time for when weaken is complete. Needs singleton to calculate specific
 *      actions due to varying speeds for servers with varying RAM.
 *
 *      Calculate based on length of 'purchased servers minus excluded servers' if there will be servers
 *      less than 3 members. If so, track orphans and make them into RAM sharers.
